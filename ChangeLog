2024-12-09 Gavin Salam + Matteo Cacciari + Gregory Soyez

	* VERSION:

	upped to 1.057-devel

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure:

	modification to scheme for support of dependencies between contribs. 
	It now requires contribs to be in a new form where there is a 
	ContribName/FJCONTRIB.cfg file that contains the version number and
	any dependencies. 

	* scripts/internal/common.sh:
	* scripts/release-contrib.sh:

	various changes to support the new scheme with
	ContribName/FJCONTRIB.cfg files and the option to have either that
	or the old ContribName/VERSION file.

	* scripts/internal/Template:
	* scripts/new-contrib-from-template.sh:
	* DEVEL-GUIDELINES:

	adapted things to be in the new scheme with an FJCONTRIB.cfg file
	that contains both the version number and the dependencies and has
	the include files in a include/fastjet/contrib/ subdirectory. 
	
	The new include placement help reduce the risk of conflicts with
	system include files and also has the benefit that example programs
	don't need to have their #include statements modified in order to
	still work with a full installation of fjcontrib.

	Also added a note in the DEVEL-GUIDELINES that fjcontrib maintainers
	may modify and release new versions of contribs if needed, e.g.
	to fix bugs, after attempting to contact authors.

2024-11-25 Mon  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure:
	started work on support for dependencies between contribs;
	if a file ContribName/DEPENDS is present, then the contribs
	listed will be dependencies. 
	
	Technically, configure now generates targets ContribName.all,
	ContribName.check and ContribName.ex, ContribName.install with the
	latter three depending on the first one. The dependency is then made
	explicit for ContribName.all.

2024-10-20  Gavin Salam  <salam@hydra>

	added details of how to set svn:keywords on source files.

2014-03-14  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.in (distclean):
	distclean depended on CMS-shared-distclean when it should have
	been fragile-shared-distclean.

2014-03-01  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * scripts/internal/generate-html-contents.pl
        added (and set) option to list the contribs alphabetically.
        Also added (but not activated) option to include the date using the

2014-01-31  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr> + Gregory + Matteo

	* configure:
	* Makefile.in:
	added targets fragile-shared fragile-shared-install and fragile-shared-distclean;
	the fragile-shared(-install) builds (installs) a
	libfastjetcontribfragile.so file. This is currently very fragile, in 
	that it relies on just the SRCS formatting in the individual
	contrib makefiles (all sources on a single line, without wildcards).

2014-01-20  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.in:
	* utils/check.sh: 

	arranged for make check to exit with error on failure from within
	subdirectories, but to exit OK on failure when called from the
	main directory (previous behaviour was to always exit OK).

	Removed redundant "exit 1" from the check.sh code (exit always
	handled by print_status_and_exit(...)).

	Also, when called directly from a subdirectory, make check no
	longer records its output in the test_summary.tmp file, and it now
	prints a colour-coded success/failure message.

2013-10-24  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* scripts/internal/switch-to-version.sh:
	updated to add support for branches

	* scripts/update-contribs.sh (script_new_version):
	fixed an issue with checking out versions containing a '-' [the
	regular expression matching pattern was consifering these as
	"to-be-skipped"]

2013-10-21  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* DEVEL-GUIDELINES:
	added some first thoughts on guidelines for reviewing

2013-09-24  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* NEWS:

2013-09-22  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
        replaced with new file including also particle ID and charge.
        The events remain the same (up to, sometimes, differences in
        the last digit), the "make check" still work without changing
        the old reference files

2013-09-22  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * utils/check.sh
        added a safety check to verify if tput is present on the system
        before using it to set colors

2013-09-19  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * utils/check.sh
        added colors to Success/Failed output from "make check"

        * scripts/internal/generate-html-contents.pl 
        a flag can now be set to get an alphabetically ordered
        output (currently set to false, i.e. same output as before)

2013-09-19  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* Makefile.in:
	* utils/check.sh:
	instead of having "make check" exit with an error whenever a test
	fails, let it keep going and print a summary of what has failed
	and succeded at the end of everything

2013-09-03  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* contribs.svn:
	switched SubjetCounting to version 1.0.1

	added SubjetCounting 1.0.0

2013-08-28  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * configure
          fixed two bugs that were preventing specifying more than
          one contrib with the --only and --exclude options. The issues
          were a spurious "/" appearing in the replacement of commas with
          blanks in the contribs list, and a non-escaped command-line
          passed through sed when writing out the Makefile.

2013-08-27  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* VERSION:
	* NEWS:
	released fjcontrib 1.006 including Nsubjettiness 1.0.3

2013-08-13  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* configure: 
	identification of svn info fixed to work also with svn 1.8 (that
	version prints an absolute and relative URL, and configure was
	picking up both; now it picks up just the absolute URL).

	* scripts/internal/release-fjcontrib.sh:
	hopefully fixed bug where tagging comment didn't have version
	number (but '$version')

2013-07-24  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* DEVEL-GUIDELINES: 
	mentioned that authors can ask for input from fjcontrib
	maintainers before making a release

2013-05-22  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* configure:
	for contribs obtained through an svn checkout (e.g. for
	developers), it now supplements version info from the
	ContribName/VERSION file with info about the svn location.

2013-05-07  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* scripts/internal/common.sh:
	further replacement [ \t] -> [[:space:]] for the fix
	mentioned below, since the first one fails to recognize tabs
	(only blanks worked)

2013-05-01  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* NEWS: 
	* VERSION:
	release of 1.003

	* contribs.svn: 
	put in EnergyCorrelator 1.0.0

2013-04-29  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr> + Matteo

	reworded comments at the top of the script to reflect the changes
	made with 'contribs.local'

2013-04-28  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr> + Gregory

        * scripts/update-contribs.sh
	* scripts/internal/common.sh	
	* contribs.svn	
	replaced contribs.local with local_svn to avoid confusion with
	the name of the file that will eventually be used to contain
	local modifications to contribs.svn. 
	Fixed a regular expression in grep (allowing for mixture of spaces
	and tabs before the contrib name)
	Also reworded some comments.
	
	Added support for a contribs.local overriding default entries in
	contribs.svn. Added option to skip processing of a specific 
	contribution by scripts/update-contribs.sh, by replacing version
	number with any number of dashes.
