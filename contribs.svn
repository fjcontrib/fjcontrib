# This file contains the list of all contribs and their current 
# (default) version. It is read by scripts/update-contribs.sh
#
# You should NOT MODIFY this file, but rather write your
# local modifications in contribs.local, with the same format.
# They will take precedence.
#
# The format is mostly two-column, where the location is a 
# relative location pointing to a stable release (tags/...), 
# the trunk (trunk) or a branch (branch/...) 
# [branch is unsupported at the moment]
#
# A contribution can be skipped by replacing the location name
# with at least a "-", e.g. "----"
